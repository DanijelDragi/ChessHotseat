# ChessHotseat
2 player hotseat chess with replays.

When the game starts you are presented with a chess board set up with pieces ready to play.

You may select a piece and move it according to chess rules. 

There are UNDO and REDO buttons in case you wish to change a move or rewind the game. 

The RESTART button resets the game sending all the pieces to their starting positions. 

If at any point you wish to save your game, for watching later or to continue a match, you can press the SAVE button and enter a name for your save file. The game will be saved and the board reset. 

To load a game for watching/playing you can press the LOAD button and enter the save file name which loads all the moves saved in the save file, and enables the redo button. By pressing the redo button the moves are repeated in order as they were played. At any point you can choose to move pieces on your own in which case the saved moves are no longer going to unfold by pressing redo, and instead you can continue the game from that point.

The game does not warn you about "check" conditions in order not to take away from the experience of playing and having to keep track of the board. The same goes for "Checkmate". The game will not warn you if you performed Checkmate, instead the game is won by capturing the opposing players king piece (which can only be done from a checkmate position).
